RED WINE QUALITY PREDICTION- USING MACHINE LEARNING

Completed this project as part of my Data Science and Machine learning internship with United Network Of Professionals(UNP).Key highlights:

1.Studied and analyzed the Student grade prediction dataset to apply ML models and present my insights.

2.Performed various Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and compare the variables

3.Experimented with different Machine Learning algorithms, Linear Regression Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, SVM and K-Nearest
Neighbours Regression
.
4.compared the results to recommend the best Regression model.
